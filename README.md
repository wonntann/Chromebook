# Troubleshooting
## ChromeOS with Linux Turned On
This will be addressing issues on ChromeOS Linux, but you can apply some of them to either boot. Follow each point in order or jump to the bullet point that you need to address your issues.

* Restart ChromeOS
* Update packages through the Terminal app, run this command:
  ``` bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
  ``` 
* Open termina in Chrome browser by entering:
  ``` bash
  vsh termina
  ```
* To create a gnu-container, enter the termina, then type the following command:
* ``` bash
  lxc config set penguin security.nesting true
  lxc launch ubuntu:18.04
   ```
